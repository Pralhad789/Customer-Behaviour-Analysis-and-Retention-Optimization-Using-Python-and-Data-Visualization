# Maximizing-Customer-Loyalty-and-CLV-through-Data-Driven-Strategies

## Business Overview 
A mobile network operator, offering a variety of services including voice, data, and digital content, has been experiencing increasing customer churn rates over the past year. With fierce competition in the wireless communications industry and the high costs associated with customer acquisition, reducing churn has become critical for maintaining profitability and market share. Customer churn, defined as the rate at which users leave or cancel their mobile services, has been steadily rising, leading to concerns about customer loyalty and overall revenue retention.

The leadership team has tasked the data analytics team with uncovering the key factors driving customer churn and proposing actionable solutions to reduce it. A successful churn reduction strategy could potentially save millions of dollars in lost revenue and improve customer lifetime value (CLV).

## Project Overview
This project addresses the following critical business problems:
1. Increasing Customer Churn Rates
2. Ineffective Pricing Strategies
3. Low Customer Engagement and Loyalty

To tackle these business challenges, conducted an **exploratory data analysis** (EDA) using **Python** on a dataset of over 7,000 customer records, analyzing various features such as customer demographics, service usage, account details, and churn status. 

* Data Cleaning and Preparation: Using **Pandas**, cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting categorical variables into numerical formats for analysis.

* Descriptive Statistics: Employed **NumPy** to calculate key metrics and descriptive statistics, providing insights into customer demographics, churn rates, and service usage patterns.

* Visualization: Utilized **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizing data distributions and relationships, helping to identify trends and patterns associated with customer churn.

* Correlation Analysis: By analyzing correlations between various features and churn status, pinpointed critical factors influencing customer retention, such as contract types, payment methods, and service engagement.

* Actionable Insights: Based on the analysis, we developed targeted strategies to improve customer loyalty, such as promoting long-term contracts, enhancing pricing models, and optimizing service offerings.
